# Online Bookstore

## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive Vue3-based online bookstore with front-end and back-end separation, showcasing proficiency in various modern web technologies and system design. It includes the following core features:
* User login and registration
* Book search and browsing
* Shopping cart system
* Order management system (including returns and cancellations)
* User information management
* Additional features to be added later

Back-end development is handled using C++ with Qt for UI integration, demonstrating advanced skills in leveraging C++ for efficient back-end processing and seamless integration with sophisticated UI frameworks.

## Frameworks Used
The project utilizes a diverse set of frameworks and tools, demonstrating expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies:
* Vue3
* Vuelidate for form validation
* Bootstrap for styling
* Axios for HTTP requests
* SweetAlert for user notifications
* jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Distpicker for address selection
* QWebChannel for integration with Qt
* Additional frameworks and tools may be added as needed

## Key Features Implemented

### User Management
The project supports robust user login and registration features, allowing users to create accounts and access personalized features while ensuring data integrity and security. The user profile page includes a basic layout for managing personal information.

### Product Browsing and Search
Users can efficiently browse and search for books, with advanced pagination and search functionality to ensure smooth navigation and exploration of the available inventory.

### Order Management
The order management system is a sophisticated feature that allows users to view and manage their orders, supporting multiple order statuses (e.g., all orders, pending payment, awaiting receipt, completed, canceled). This system is designed to provide a seamless experience for tracking and managing orders, with dynamic UI elements such as:
* Display styles for different order types
* A side navigation bar (SideMenu) with dynamic highlighting based on the selected order query type
* Top navigation highlighting and order operation buttons (e.g., pay, cancel, view details)
* Pagination and order search functionality, displaying relevant pages based on the total count

### Shopping Cart System
The shopping cart page is designed for an optimal user experience, including:
* Layout adjustments for better user experience
* A "checkout" button that displays a popup with the user's default address and selected items
* A "select all" button that allows users to select all items, with requests handled through the back-end service layer

### Integration with Qt
The project also demonstrates an innovative approach by integrating Vue with Qt, showcasing the ability to adapt and integrate modern front-end frameworks with native UI components. Routing adjustments were successfully made to ensure compatibility, and a sample admin interface was developed to validate the integration, reflecting versatility in combining different technologies effectively.
